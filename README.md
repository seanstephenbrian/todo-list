# [now // later](https://seanstephenbrian.github.io/todo-list/)

**now // later** is a streamlined to-do list web app.

the site allows you to save to-do tasks with a title, description, and a priority of either 'now' 
or 'later'. on the main page, the user can toggle between views of the 'now' tasks, 'later' tasks, and all tasks.

the warm, minimal design makes use of color tones found in the work of architect frank lloyd wright.
sun & moon icons in the header allow you to toggle between light and dark modes.

the to-do list itself is an array of to-do objects, and the user's unique list is saved in 
localStorage, allowing them to seamlessly pick up where they left off when they return to the site. 
tasks can be edited, deleted, or marked as complete.
